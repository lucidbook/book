## Style Guide & General Guidelines
Here's a few guidelines for writing articles for this book, that should help you
format everything to be consistent.

### Titles
- Should either be in "Title Case" or "Written as a sentence?" depending on
    their usage.

### Chapter Naming
- Title in SUMMARY.md should be short and "Title Case".
- Title in filename should be "dash-case" without capitals.
- Title in the article itself can deviate from or expand on the SUMMARY.md
    title.

### External Links, References, and Attribution
- Links to articles within the book or external sites are in separate sections
    at the bottom of the article.
- Articles and techniques are not attributed to individual people within the
    book.
    These guides and techniques are worked and improved on by everyone.
    If you feel attribution is needed, use a "References" or "Further Reading"
    section at the bottom of the article.
    Giving thanks to specific people for contributing or writing articles is of
    course fine, it's just important that nobody *owns* an article.
- No linking or advertising software.
    This dates the guide and locks out people who don't want to or can't use
    specific software.
    If you absolutely *have to* it should be Open Source software, which is more
    likely to survive longer.
