# Lucid Dreaming Basics
So you're interested in lucid dreaming, great!
Welcome to the start of your journey into entirely different worlds.

If you don't know what lucid dreaming is, first read the chapter [What is Lucid Dreaming](techniques/lucidity/what-is-lucid-dreaming.html).
That will give you a good introduction.

This guide will explain the basics of lucid dreaming, basic terminology, and how
to get yourself started with the most basic of lucid dreaming techniques,
"reality checks".
From there it will guide you into what to try next in your lucid dreams, the
basics of dream control, and what other lucid dreaming techniques to try.
This guide is ordered in sequence of what information will be most relevant to
you at your level of understanding after reading the previous chapter, but it
can be read in any order you want.

## I need this **RIGHT NOW** what's the fastest way to do this?
Woah there, calm yourself down a bit.
Lucid dreaming certainly is very appealing, and a great experience, but rushing
to it won't work.
There is no fastest way or quick easy way to reach a lucid dream, it takes time
and persistence, and figuring out what works for you.
(No matter how much some supplement sellers would like to convince you otherwise)

If you're not feeling comfortable in your own body, or are suffering from
problems in your life, you may feel like you absolutely *need* to learn this.
This however will work against you.
Take a step back, figure out your life, talk to a therapist.
Escaping into a lucid dream won't solve any problems for you, no matter how much
it sounds like a panacea.

You need to approach lucid dreaming with patience.
It's likely that it's going to take some time before you get into a lucid dream
where you can actually do the things you want to do.
Enjoy the journey.
Enjoy the benefits you get from all the techniques that help you achieve lucid
dreams.
Enjoy the weird experiences you get that aren't lucid dreams but still something
different, something unique.

Take your time, enjoy the small victories and benefits, and before you know it
you're suddenly standing in your own personal world, able to do whatever you
want.
