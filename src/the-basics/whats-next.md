# What's Next?
At this point, you've reached the end of the basics guide.
Congratulations!
You can freely explore the rest of the book as you want, and read guides that
interest you.
You can also look over the links on the introduction page and read guides on
other sites.

Remember once again, lucid dreaming is going to take a while for you to get used
to it and get a first lucid dream.
Unlike what some guides like to claim, you can't do this overnight.
Remember to relax and enjoy the process, you'll get a lucid dream eventually!

Have fun, Good Night, and Good Luck!
