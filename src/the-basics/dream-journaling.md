# Dream Journaling
As you delve deeper into the world of lucid dreaming, you'll come to know that there are many technique styles and personalized versions of everything. Dream journaling is something that is entirely personal and up to you in style.

## What is a dream journal used for?
A dream journal is used to write down dreams you remember during the night. It is also the main technique for improving recall of dreams.

## How do I do it?
There are many ways that we lucid dreamers like to dream journal, although the most common are as follows, not in order: a notebook and a pen or pencil, a smartphone, and a computer.
I tend to use a notebook to jot down notes of the dream, what the setting was, the characters, and what they/I did. Then, after I clear my mind of the morning jumble, I open my computer and use a program called Sleeping Lab 2.

## Do I have to dream journal?
Anything you do, is entirely up to you. Although most people insist on doing it, some people never dream journal. It is, in my opinion, a lucid dreaming essential. It improves dream recall, you can look back and find dream signs (we'll talk about that later), and overall, remember the great times and lucid dreams that you've had. Dream recall is important, because without it, you could've had an amazing cinematic dream and not even remember it, without recall.
