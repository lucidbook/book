# Dream Recall
So you've decided to learn lucid dreaming, where do you start?
Well, let's start with a very common problem many people run in to, remembering
your dreams.
I mean, what's the point in having a lucid dream if you don't remember it?
And you're also missing out on remembering tons of great adventures you're
having every night!
There's various methods for remembering dreams, in this chapter we'll only be
going over the most common and reliable ones.

## Dream Journals
The staple of every lucid dreaming diet!
Dream journals are by far the most reliable technique for drastically improving
your recall.
Even if you barely ever remember your dreams this will help you a lot.

The easiest moment to remember your dreams is in the morning right after waking
up.
When you wake up, the first thing you should do is stay in bed, and try your
best possible to remember the dream you just had.
Spend some time on this, it's alright if it takes a while, and it's alright if
you can't manage to remember it.

Now if you remembered a dream, write it down somewhere.
Write as many details as you can remember.
The more details you write, the more you'll be able to remember this dream in
the future, and the more you'll remember of dreams after this.
As you're writing, you might be remembering even more, so keep writing all of
that down.
If you can't remember anything, just write down "No dream recalled".
Just make sure you write something every single day, this will keep your journal
as being important in your mind.

Doing this will signal to your mind that dream recall is important to you.
Over time you'll find it easier and easier to remember dreams.
Most people leave it just at this technique but if you want to do some more...

## Recall Your Day
Right before sleeping or doing whatever technique you're planning to do for
lucid dreaming, think back to your day.
Try to remember it from start to finish.
This will prime your mind for better recall during the night.

## It's not working!
Sometimes, you'll just get a while where you'll have no recall whatsoever.
This happens even to the most experienced lucid dreamers now and then.
Just keep journaling, even if you can't remember anything, and eventually your
recall will come back.
