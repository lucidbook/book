# MILD - Mnemonically Induced Lucid Dream
Now that you've learned about the very basics of lucid dreaming, it's time to
move on to one of the techniques that make it easier to become lucid.
The MILD technique is very beginner-friendly, and has been very effective
overall, regardless of experience.

MILD works by teaching your mind what should be happening in a dream, and
affirming to yourself that you *will* lucid dream.
This way you're training your mind to lucid dream without actually having to
be in a lucid dream yet to do it.

With this technique it's important to do it *every day*.
Persistence and consistency are the key to successful MILD.
If you wake up in the morning after having done MILD and haven't gotten a lucid
dream, it just means you've worked further towards one.
Every night trains your mind a bit more and eventually you'll start to see
results.

## So how does it work?
