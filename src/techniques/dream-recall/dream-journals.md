# Dream Journals
The staple of every lucid dreaming diet!
Dream journals are a very reliable technique for drastically improving your
recall.
Even if you barely ever remember your dreams this will help you a lot.

The easiest moment to remember your dreams is in the morning right after waking
up.
When you wake up, the first thing you should do is stay in bed, and try your
best possible to remember the dream you just had.
Spend some time on this, it's alright if it takes a while, and it's alright if
you can't manage to remember it.

Now if you remembered a dream, write it down somewhere.
Write as many details as you can remember.
The more details you write, the more you'll be able to remember this dream in
the future, and the more you'll remember of dreams after this.
As you're writing, you might be remembering even more, so keep writing all of
that down.
If you can't remember anything, just write down "No dream recalled".
Just make sure you write something every single day, this will keep your journal
as being important in your mind.

Doing this will signal to your mind that dream recall is important to you.
Over time you'll find it easier and easier to remember dreams.
