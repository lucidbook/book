# Wake up, Back to Bed
This is a simple technique that gives you a significant boost to your lucidity.
It is also generally considered a requirement for WILD techniques during the
night, as you want to be close to REM to do WILD.

To do WBTB, you wake up 4-5 hours after you've gone to sleep.
Then, you spend a brief amount of time raising your awareness, preferably
without making yourself more awake overall.
Go to the bathroom, get a glass of water, or spend a few minutes meditating.

The duration you're awake depends on what you want to do and what works for you,
it can be anything from a few seconds to half an hour.
