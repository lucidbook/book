# What is lucid dreaming?
Lucid dreaming as its very basic form is being aware that you're dreaming.
This is also called being "lucid".
If this sounds completely normal to you, you may be someone who naturally lucid
dreams.
Most people don't naturally do this however, and have to train themselves to
become lucid in dreams.
The term is also used as an umbrella term for actually making use of this
lucidity.
Being lucid gives you a lot of power over the dream world itself, you can do
anything you want in a dream.

If you've never heard of this before, this may sound like a concept completely
foreign to you, or even like pseudoscience paranormal gobbledygook.
Lucid dreaming however is widely acknowledged as a real thing, even in
psychology.
Everyone can learn to lucid dream and there's nothing paranormal about it.
While for some people it can be a jumping board into paranormal experiences,
this book will not go into that or comment on the validity of it.
If you're interested in these things that's alright, you do you, this book just
won't help you with that beyond lucid dreaming itself.

## But it's a dream, won't it all feel fake?
It's technically all imagined yes, but that doesn't mean it's not real to your
mind.
Lucid dreams can feel incredibly real, or even hyper-real as your senses in
dreams are not filtered interpretations of your real life sensory organs, but
direct feeds from the dream world.
People who wear glasses generally don't need them in dreams.

This is not to say that dreams are indistinguishable from real life, in fact
there's a lot of things that are very different.
These are just part of the experience, and allow you to change the world around
you, your own appearance, travel to different locations quickly, or do various
other interesting things you can't do in real life.
Opening a door in a dream for example might lead nowhere, or somewhere
completely unexpected.

## But I barely ever have dreams
Yes you do! Everyone has dreams every night, the hard part is remembering them.
But you can train this!

## But won't this make me really tired?
Nope!
Dreaming happens during REM sleep, which isn't meant to give you rest.
You can spend every single dream completely lucid and not miss out on any rest
at all.
As well while lucid dreaming you may become more aware of how sleep works and
how to better plan in your sleep to be more rested overall.
